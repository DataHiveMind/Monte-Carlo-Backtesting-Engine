# Project Design

## Overview
The Monte Carlo Backtesting Engine is a Python-based library designed to simulate and evaluate financial strategies. Its modular architecture ensures flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, making it suitable for quantitative research and trading.

## Key Components
### 1. Data Module
- **`data_loader.py`**: Handles the loading and preprocessing of historical market data.
- **Input**: Raw financial data (e.g., CSV files containing prices and dates).
- **Output**: Cleaned and enriched data, including features like moving averages.

### 2. Engine Module
- **`monte_carlo.py`**: Implements Monte Carlo simulations using stochastic modeling to assess potential outcomes for strategies.
- **`backtester.py`**: Core backtesting logic to simulate trades, portfolio changes, and strategy evaluation over historical data.
- **`strategy.py`**: Defines strategies that generate trading signals (e.g., buy/sell) based on input data.
- **`portfolio.py`**: Manages the portfolio, tracks cash flow, and calculates portfolio performance.

### 3. Metrics Module
- **`metrics.py`**: Provides performance evaluation metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized returns.

### 4. Utility Module
- **`utils/`**: Contains helper functions for various tasks (e.g., data handling and preprocessing).

### 5. Notebooks
- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Exploratory data analysis notebook to understand data distributions and patterns.
- **`results_analysis.ipynb`**: Analyzes backtest results and compares strategy performance.

### 6. Tests
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests for all modules to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Architectural Decisions
### Modularity
Each component of the system is designed to be independent. This allows for:
- Easier debugging and testing.
- Seamless integration of new features or changes.

### Scalability
The system is built to support various use cases, from simple threshold-based strategies to complex quantitative models.

### Extensibility
Custom strategies and metrics can easily be integrated by following the defined base classes and standards.

## Flow of the System
1. **Load Data**: Use `data_loader.py` to preprocess input data.
2. **Define Strategy**: Implement custom logic using the `Strategy` base class.
3. **Run Backtest**: Use `Backtester` to simulate the strategy's performance over historical data.
4. **Analyze Results**: Evaluate results with `results_analysis.ipynb` and `metrics.py`.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Transaction Costs**: Include fees for buying/selling assets.
2. **Multi-Asset Support**: Extend portfolio management to handle multiple assets simultaneously.
3. **Advanced Strategies**: Implement machine learning-based models for signal generation.
