# Monte Carlo Backtesting Engine
## Overview

The Monte Carlo Backtesting Engine is a robust and flexible Python library designed for quantitative researchers, traders, and data scientists. This project provides tools to simulate and analyze financial strategies using Monte Carlo simulations and backtesting, helping to assess the performance and robustness of investment strategies under various scenarios.

## Features

- Monte Carlo Simulations: Generate and analyze a range of possible outcomes for financial strategies based on stochastic processes.

- Backtesting Framework: Implement, test, and optimize investment strategies with historical data.

- Portfolio Management: Simulate portfolio allocation, rebalancing, and risk management.

- Custom Strategies: Design and test user-defined trading strategies.

- Performance Metrics: Evaluate key statistics such as Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and cumulative returns.

- Data Utilities: Built-in tools for data preprocessing and loading.

- Visualization: Leverage Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and result visualizations.
